Implement Keycloak HA Setup with External DB
Objective:
Implement a High Availability (HA) setup for Keycloak with an external database,
including backup and integration with a service for authentication in Azure. Use tools
like Terraform and Ansible. Additionally, create an architecture diagram, deployment
concept, documentation for the operations team (Day 1 operations), and a restore plan.
Task Breakdown:
1. Setup Keycloak HA Environment:
o Provision Infrastructure:
§ Use Terraform to provision the necessary infrastructure (e.g., VMs,
networking, load balancers).
§ Ensure the infrastructure is scalable and resilient.
o Install Keycloak:
§ Use Ansible to automate the installation of Keycloak on the
provisioned VMs. Alternatively make use of an AKS cluster.
§ Configure Keycloak in a clustered mode to ensure high availability.
o External Database Configuration:
§ Set up an external database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for
Keycloak.
o Backup
§ Ensure the service(s) is(are) highly available and backed up
regularly.
1. Backup and Restore:
o Backup Strategy:
§ Implement a backup strategy for both Keycloak and the external
database.
§ Automate the backup process.
o Restore Plan:
§ Document the steps required to restore Keycloak and the
database from backups.
§ Test the restore process to ensure it works as expected.
1. Service Integration:
o Connect a Service:
§ Integrate a sample service (e.g., a web application) with Keycloak
for authentication.
§ Ensure the service can authenticate users via Keycloak.
1. Documentation:
o Architecture Diagram:
§ Create a detailed architecture diagram showing the Keycloak HA
setup, external database, and integrated service.
o Deployment Concept:
§ Document the deployment process, including infrastructure
provisioning, Keycloak installation, and service integration.

o Day 1 Operations:
§ Create documentation for the operations team covering Day 1
operations, including monitoring, maintenance, and
troubleshooting.
Deliverables:
o Terraform scripts for infrastructure provisioning.
o Ansible playbooks for Keycloak installation and configuration.
o Backup and restore scripts.
o Sample service integrated with Keycloak.
o Architecture diagram.
o Deployment concept document.
o Day 1 operations documentation.
Evaluation Criteria:
• Successful deployment of Keycloak in HA mode.
• Reliable backup and restore process.
• Successful integration of the sample service with Keycloak.
• Comprehensive and clear documentation.
